# Virtual-Mouse
Virtual Mouse Using OpenCV
In this project, we have created a virtual mouse using oneâ€™s own fingers.
Project Description:
I am using my hand as a virtual mouse that can do everything a mouse can do without even touching your system. To detect my hands, I use the webcam on my system. Then it will create a bounding box around my hand and focus on my forefinger and middle finger. The forefinger will act as a cursor, and when we move it, the cursor will move as well. For hand tracking to be successful, it must detect the distance between the forefinger and middle finger. A click will be performed if they are joined together.
Furthermore, a smoothness factor was added as the movement was really shaky.


Requirements:
OpenCV:
 OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
Mediapipe:
MediaPipe offers cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. End-to-End acceleration: Built-in fast ML inference and processing accelerated even on common hardware. Build once, deploy anywhere: Unified solution works across Android, iOS, desktop/cloud, web, and IoT.
AutoPy:
AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation library for Python. It includes functions for controlling the keyboard and mouse, finding colors and bitmaps on-screen, and displaying alerts.
